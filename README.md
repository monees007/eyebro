For a visually impaired person, even a short walk across campus can feel uncertain and stressful. There might be a low-hanging branch, an unexpected step, a slippery path after rain, or a crowded corridor — things that a normal **walking stick may miss**. Because of this, many people hesitate to move around alone and often need to rely on someone else, even for simple daily tasks.

**Eyebro** tries to change that feeling. It helps users “sense” obstacles through **voice** and **vibration**, giving them a little more confidence, safety, and freedom to move on their own.
